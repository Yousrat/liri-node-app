# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Here is how to play with this file:
after you browse to the folder, go to the command line and type node liri.js followed by one of these options:
 option1: movie-this "enter your movie of choice between quotations"
 option2: spotify-this-song "enter your song of choice between quotations"
 option3 (this one will show you my own latest 20 tweets): my-tweets
